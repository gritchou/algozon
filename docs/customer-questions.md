# Question 1:

Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:
- Records
- Indexing

I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking." 

Cheers,
George

Hello Georges,

Thanks for reaching out! Here are a few pointers.

Records represent the data that comes from your business. It comes as a json file in which you describe your products and their attributes. It also associates your users' search targets with categories and hierarchical categories. For example, for an ecommerce website, it usually contains a name, description, brand, price, …
Once it’s well formatted, you can upload your Record with Algolia’s Dashboard or via the API into an Index (a storage place which contains the data used by a search engine). 
Then, Algolia’s servers will process the indexing of your data and optimize them for search.

I just talked with John Smith, one of our Solutions Architects and he is more than willing to help you through this process.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Best,

# Question 2:

Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards,
Matt

# Question 3:
Hi,

I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high-level process look like?

Hello Leo,

Thanks for showing interest in Algolia's Solution!

Algolia is provided with a lot of custom widgets designed specifically for the main frontend frameworks (Angular, React, Vue, Vanilla JS).
This helps companies to integrate our solution very quickly.
The process of integrating Algolia to your website would be:
1. Create an Algolia account and index your data.
2. Configure the basic relevance settings for the data.
3. Configure your website to use your API search key and start to use Algolia's widgets.

It can be done with Algolia's dashboard or via the API. Our team will be more than ready to help you get through all these steps.


Would you be interested in hoping on a short call to help me understand your project better and answer any more questions you have?

I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best,

Jean-François
